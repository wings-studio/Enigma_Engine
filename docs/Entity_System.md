# Event-Action System in Enigma Engine
This system looks like Source I/O System. But what is Event-Action System. Sometimes game or entities execute some **events**. For example: button pressed - it is event. Or game finished - it is event too. And other entities want to react on these events. For example: door open, when button pressed. These reactions named **actions**. And all this system of events and actions is *Event-Action System*. Every entity have own events and actions.
